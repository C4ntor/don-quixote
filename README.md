don-quixote (DQ Rush) is among the first A.I. assisted developed videogame. 
The project was started to show how easy it is to use Artificial Intelligence as support tool to develop small-medium size videogame projects, allowing to have a full runnable 3D Videogame in less than 3 days working on it in discontinuous manner (A single day is the estimated time required to develop it in full time session).

-All Artworks have been generated by Microsoft Bing Image Creator.
-The 3D Models have been created, starting from ONE SINGLE Image Artwork, by using the 3D Gaussian Splatting Algorithm.
-Animations and rigging were made possible thanks to Adobe Mixamo.

The game is developed using the Unity 3D Game Engine.
The project is not intended to be a Commercial Product, it was developed exclusively for educational purposes.
